Allow to get the gyrometers and accelerometers values on sticks inputs for Xbox360 controller.
--Modified by Luxoris for an Educational Project

# BetterJoyForCemu v5 (v6 Nightly)
Allows the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and Joycons to be used with [Cemu](http://cemu.info/) using [Cemuhook](https://sshnuke.net/cemuhook/), [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/), and system-wide with generic XInput support.

If anyone would like to donate (for whatever reason), [you can do so here](https://www.paypal.me/DavidKhachaturov/5). 

#### Personal note
Thank you for using my software and all the constructive feedback I've been getting about it. I started writing this project a while back and have since then learnt a lot more about programming and software development in general. I don't have too much time to work on this project, but I will try to fix bugs when and if they arise. Thank you for your patience in that regard too!

It's been quite a wild ride, with nearly 90k official download on GitHub and probably many more through the nightlies. I think this project was responsible for both software jobs I landed so far, so I am quite proud of it.


## Nightly builds (updated 18/01/20)
Due to popular request (and my fear of releasing full builds without many new features), I will post newer "unofficial" builds here so you can test out the latest features and fixes.

* Initial release

# How to use
1. Install drivers
    1. Run *! Driver Install (Run as Admin).bat*
2. Run BetterJoyForCemu.exe
    1. If running for the first time, things might glitch out - just close BetterJoyForCemu normally and restart your computer for the drivers to take effect.
    2. If not, see the __Problems__ section.
3. Connect your controllers.
4. Start Cemu and ensure CemuHook has the controller selected.
    1. If using Joycons, CemuHook will detect two controllers - each will give all buttons, but choosing one over the other just chooses preference for which hand to use for gyro controls.
5. Go into *Input Settings*, choose XInput as a source and assign buttons normally.
    1. If you don't want to do this for some reason, just have one input profile set up with *Wii U Gamepad* as the controller and enable "Also use for buttons/axes" under *GamePad motion source*. **This is no longer required as of version 3**
    2. Turn rumble up to 70-80% if you want rumble.

* As of version 3, you can use the pro controller and Joycons as normal xbox controllers on your PC - try it with Steam!

# App Settings
Feel free to edit *BetterJoyForCemu.exe.config* before running the program to configure it to your liking.

For example, for use with [Citra and Steam simultaneously](https://community.citra-emu.org/t/improvements-to-motion-control/42125), you may consider turning off *UseHIDG* and *ShowAsXInput*.

Current settings are:
* IP address of CemuHook motion server  *(default: 127.0.0.1)*
* Port number of CemuHook motion server *(default: 26760)*
* Rumble Period of motor in ms          *(default: 300)*
* Frequency of low rumble in Hz         *(default: 20)*
* Frequency of high rumble in Hz        *(default: 400)*
* Rumble - en/disables rumble           *(default: true)*
* Swap A-B                              *(default: false)*
  * Swaps the A-B buttons to mimick the Xbox layout by button name, rather than physical layout 
* Swap X-Y                              *(default: false)*
  * Swaps the X-Y buttons to mimick the Xbox layout by button name, rather than physical layout 
* PurgeWhitelist                        *(default: true)*
  * Determines whether or not HidGuardian's process whitelist is purged on start-up
* UseHIDG                               *(default: true)*
  * Determines whether or not to use HidGuardian (improves compatibility with other programs, like Steam, when set to "false")
* ShowAsXInput                          *(default: true)*
  * Determines whether or not the program will expose detected controllers as Xbox 360 controllers
* PurgeAffectedDevices                  *(default: true)*
  * Determines whether or not the program should purge the affected devices list upon exit
  * Should prevent any more issues of the controller being unusable after the program
* NonOriginalController                 *(default: false)*
  * When "true", click the "Calibrate" button once to calibrate the gyroscope on your connect pro controller
# Problems
__Make sure you installed the drivers!!__

__Controller is not recognised after using the program__

Before uninstalling the drivers, navigate to http://localhost:26762/ and remove all the devices from the "Currently affected devices" list and then restart your computer.

__Make pro controller or Joycons visible to other programs again without uninstalled HidGuardian__

BetterJoyForCemu automatically adds Joycons and Pro Controllers to HidGuardian's blacklist upon start-up.

However, to manually remove the devices from the blacklist, one can navigate to this page: http://localhost:26762/

__Calibration Issues (ex: sticks don't have full range)__

Switch off "also use for axes/buttons" under motion settings and set the input deadzones to 0.

__Motion controls don't work/work badly__

While the program is running, turn off your controller (if USB - unplug, if BT - press the sync button) and then turn it back on (press any button).

__No Joycons detected__

If using Bluetooth - see the "How to properly disconnect the controller" section and follow the steps listed there. Then, reconnect the controller.

If using USB - try unplugging the controller and then plugging it back in, making sure to let Windows set it up before launching the program.

__Getting stuck at "Using USB" or "Using factory.."__

Close the program and then start it again. If it doesn't work, see the "No joycons detected" section and try that.

__CemuHook not recognising the controller__

Make sure that CemuHook settings are at their default state, which are -

```
serverIP = 127.0.0.1
serverPort = 26760
```

__Plugging controller into USB port does nothing__

Solution found courtresy of reddit user BFCE -  go into Device Manager, go to the Universal Serial Bus Controllers, select the properties of the eXtreme (or other USB) controllers, and toggle the setting that allows you to disable the USB ports to save power when not in use. Even some desktops have this on by default.

___Note that for Joycons to work properly, you need a decent Bluetooth adapter that is comfortable with handling 3/4 connections at a time.___

Feel free to open a new issue if you have any comments or questions.

# Connecting and Disconnecting the Controller
## Bluetooth Mode
Hold down the small button on the top of the controller for 5 seconds - this puts the controller into broadcasting mode.

Search for it in your bluetooth settings and pair normally.

To disconnect the controller - press down the button once. To reconnect - press any button on your controller.

## USB Mode
Plug the controller into your computer.

## How to properly disconnect the controller
### Windows 10
1. Go into "Bluetooth and other devices settings"
1. Under the first category "Mouse, keyboard, & pen", there should be the pro controller.
1. Click on it and a "Remove" button will be revealed.
1. Press the "Remove" button

A massive thanks goes out to [rajkosto](https://github.com/rajkosto/) for putting up with 17 emails and replying very quickly to my silly queries. The UDP server is also mostly taken from his [ScpToolkit](https://github.com/rajkosto/ScpToolkit) repo.

Also I am very grateful to [mfosse](https://github.com/mfosse/JoyCon-Driver) for pointing me in the right direction and to [Looking-Glass](https://github.com/Looking-Glass/JoyconLib) without whom I would not be able to figure anything out. (being honest here - the joycon code is his)

Many thanks to [nefarius](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEm) for his ViGEm project! Apologies and appreciation go out to [epigramx](https://github.com/epigramx), creator of *WiimoteHook*, for giving me the driver idea and for letting me keep using his installation batch script even though I took it without permission. Thanks go out to [MTCKC](https://github.com/MTCKC/ProconXInput) for inspiration and batch files.

A last thanks goes out to [dekuNukem](https://github.com/dekuNukem/Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering) for his documentation, especially on the SPI calibration data and the IMU sensor notes!
